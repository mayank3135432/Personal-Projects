Program I made during my 3rd semester to generate Truth Tables for given boolean statement.
I made it as writing Truth Tables by hand was tedious and error-prone.
It was helpful in checking my answers in Discrete Mathmatics assignments and more generally it was useful while proving mathematical statements to check whether a rule of inference is valid.
It can only accept upto 4 variable is p,q,r,s only. I tried extending it to n-variables but I was unsuccesful.
I am re-writing this entire program in C++ but I have'nt got around to finish it.
